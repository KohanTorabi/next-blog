# Next Blog - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Next Blog project, a simple blog application that allows users to view a list of posts, search for posts, add new posts, and view post details.

## Project Overview

The Next Blog frontend is built using the following technologies:

-   Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
-   React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

The frontend communicates with the backend server, which serves as the data source for the blog.

### Features

-   List of all posts with search functionality: Users can view a list of all posts and search for specific posts based on keywords.
-   Ability to add a new post: Users can add a new post to the blog by providing the required information.
